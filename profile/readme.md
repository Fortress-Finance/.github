# Fortress Finance

A production-ready multi-asset yield vault with ETH-only investment/redemption, DAO governance, and automated yield generation. Fortress Finance represents a revolutionary approach to decentralized finance by creating a diversified cryptocurrency portfolio that users can access through a single ETH investment, while maintaining community-driven governance and sustainable yield generation.

## Core Philosophy

Fortress Finance is built on the principle that **diversification is the cornerstone of sustainable wealth creation**. Rather than forcing users to manage multiple cryptocurrency positions, we provide a single-entry point (ETH) that automatically diversifies across the three most promising blockchain ecosystems: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.

## Strategic Vision

Our strategy is designed to capture the long-term value appreciation of the three most established and promising blockchain networks while providing users with:

1. **Simplified Access**: Single ETH investment for diversified exposure
2. **Risk Mitigation**: Diversification across three major blockchain ecosystems
3. **Community Governance**: DAO-driven decision making for protocol evolution
4. **Sustainable Yield**: Automated yield generation through DeFi protocols
5. **Transparent Operations**: Open-source, auditable, and community-controlled

## Project Structure

This repository contains two main components:

- **`contracts/`** - Smart contracts and deployment scripts
- **`dapp/`** - Next.js frontend application for interacting with the vault
