# Fortress Finance Roadmap

## About
A production-ready multi-asset yield vault with automatic rebalancing, circuit breakers, and emergency controls. Features Bitcoin (WBTC) and Ethereum (WETH) as the primary assets with PAXG (Pax Gold) providing gold exposure at 20% initial weight.

## 🏗️ Phase 1 — MVP: Fortress Core (0–6 months)

**Goal:** Launch a functioning Fortress Token backed by BTC, ETH, and Gold with transparent yield aggregation and rebalancing.

### 🧰 Technical Milestones

- ✅ Deploy FortressToken smart contract (core completed)
- Integrate WBTC, WETH, and wrapped gold as underlying assets
- Add rebalancing incentives & mint/redeem fee structure
- Connect to safe, audited yield sources:
  - Aave (for WBTC / WETH lending yield)
  - Gold yield source (e.g. leasing or trusted RWA vault)
- Implement performance fee harvesting to feeAddress
- Proof-of-reserves dashboard using on-chain data + Chainlink oracles

### 📊 Economic Goals

- **Target AUM:** $5–10M
- **Target Net Yield:** 3–6% annualized (conservative)
- **Fees:** 0.5% mint/redeem + 10% performance fee

### 📢 Go-to-Market

- Build initial brand presence (site, docs, audits)
- Launch transparent treasury dashboard (NAV, composition, yield metrics)
- Attract early strategic LPs (crypto-native whales, early investors)
- Launch community channels (Discord, Twitter, Medium, etc.)

## 🚀 Phase 2 — Expansion & Liquidity (6–18 months)

**Goal:** Scale liquidity, diversify yield strategies, and strengthen protocol security.

### 🧰 Technical Milestones

- Add multi-strategy adapters:
  - Compound for lending diversification
  - Lido Finance / restaking for ETH yield
  - Tokenized T-bills / gold vault for RWA exposure (institutional angle)
- Automated harvest keepers (e.g. Gelato Network or Chainlink Automation)
- Launch on-chain proof-of-reserves API for external integrations
- Integrate with major DEXes for liquid FORT/ETH & FORT/BTC pairs
- Circuit breakers and advanced risk management features

### 📊 Economic Goals

- **Target AUM:** $50–100M
- **Target Net Yield:** 5–8% annualized
- Increase velocity via deeper liquidity pools (DEX/aggregators)

### 📢 Go-to-Market

- Incentivize early liquidity providers with fee rebates or FORT staking rewards
- Integrate with DeFi dashboards (e.g. DeFiLlama, Zapper, Zerion)
- Secure audits from Tier 1 firms
- Begin partnerships with crypto fund managers & DAOs for treasury allocation

## 🏦 Phase 3 — Decentralization & Governance (18–36 months)

**Goal:** Gradually decentralize the protocol into a DAO-governed, community-owned yield asset.

### 🧰 Technical Milestones

- Deploy governance token (FORT DAO) with voting power proportional to staking or LP participation
- On-chain governance for:
  - Asset allocation & rebalancing rules
  - Fee parameter changes
  - Treasury deployment & grants
- Launch protocol-owned liquidity strategy to stabilize token markets
- Multi-sig + timelock upgrades for security

### 📊 Economic Goals

- **Target AUM:** $250–500M
- **Target Net Yield:** 6–10% annualized
- Increase share of protocol revenue to the DAO treasury

### 📢 Go-to-Market

- Launch governance forum & structured proposal process
- Onboard strategic institutions (family offices, crypto hedge funds, DAOs)
- Initiate structured treasury diversification campaigns to use FORT as a reserve asset

---

## 🌍 Phase 4 — Fortress Reserve Asset (3–5 years)

**Goal:** Position Fortress as a "super-hard-money" index — a global, decentralized yield-bearing store of value.

### 🧰 Technical Milestones

- DAO fully controls yield strategy, fee structure, and oracle risk parameters
- Multi-chain expansion (L2s and other ecosystems)
- Collateral integrations with:
  - Aave
  - MakerDAO
  - Compound
- Create FORT-backed stablecoin or credit markets (optional advanced product)
- Institutional on/off-ramps and compliance integrations

### 📊 Economic Goals

- **Target AUM:** $1B+
- **Sustainable Net Yield:** 6–12% annualized
- Fortress becomes a core collateral asset in DeFi

### 📢 Go-to-Market

- FORT integrated into treasuries of DAOs, on-chain funds, and potentially traditional finance players
- Recognition as a yield-bearing, inflation-hedged index
- Brand and governance reputation mature to "blue chip DeFi" level

## 📝 Key Strategic Themes

1. **Intrinsic value growth > BTC/USD** is achievable by combining hard assets, yield, and volatility harvesting.

2. **Build trust early** with transparency and security, decentralize later.

3. **Brand matters** — "Fortress Finance" should embody safety, growth, and composability.

4. **Think long-term:** your best marketing is a track record of real, compounded value.

## ✅ Vision Statement

**In short: we're not just launching a token.**

We're architecting a decentralized, yield-bearing monetary asset that could stand beside Bitcoin and Ethereum — not as a competitor, but as an enhanced financial layer on top of them.
