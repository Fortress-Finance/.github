# Fortress Finance

A production-ready multi-asset yield vault with ETH-only investment/redemption, DAO governance, and automated yield generation. Fortress Finance represents a revolutionary approach to decentralized finance by creating a diversified cryptocurrency portfolio that users can access through a single ETH investment, while maintaining community-driven governance and sustainable yield generation.

## Core Philosophy

Fortress Finance is built on the principle that **diversification is the cornerstone of sustainable wealth creation**. Rather than forcing users to manage multiple cryptocurrency positions, we provide a single-entry point (ETH) that automatically diversifies across the three most promising blockchain ecosystems: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.

## Strategic Vision

Our strategy is designed to capture the long-term value appreciation of the three most established and promising blockchain networks while providing users with:

1. **Simplified Access**: Single ETH investment and redemption for diversified exposure
2. **Risk Mitigation**: Diversification across three major blockchain ecosystems
3. **Community Governance**: DAO-driven decision making for protocol evolution
4. **Sustainable Yield**: Automated yield generation that directly bolsters FORT token value
5. **Transparent Operations**: Open-source, auditable, and community-controlled

## Project Structure

This repository contains the smart contract implementation:

- **`contracts/`** - Smart contracts and deployment scripts


## Portfolio Strategy

### Investment Model: ETH-Only Simplified Access

Fortress Finance revolutionizes DeFi investment by eliminating the complexity of managing multiple cryptocurrency positions. Users need only ETH to gain exposure to a professionally managed, diversified portfolio, and they always receive ETH back when redeeming their FORT tokens, regardless of the underlying portfolio composition.

#### Core Investment Flow
1. **Single Entry Point**: Users deposit ETH into the Fortress vault
2. **Automatic Diversification**: Contract instantly converts ETH into a balanced portfolio (WBTC 65%, WETH 25%, WSOL 10%)
3. **Token Representation**: Users receive FORT tokens representing their proportional share
4. **Seamless Redemption**: FORT tokens are redeemed back to ETH by automatically selling the proportional asset allocation on DEX markets

#### Technical Implementation
- **Gas Optimization**: Batch transactions minimize gas costs for portfolio rebalancing
- **Slippage Protection**: Advanced algorithms ensure optimal execution prices
- **Liquidity Management**: Maintains 20% reserve for withdrawals at all times
- **Price Oracle Integration**: Real-time pricing ensures accurate valuations

### Strategic Asset Allocation

Our portfolio allocation is based on extensive research into blockchain ecosystem fundamentals, market capitalization, and long-term growth potential:

#### Primary Holdings (65% - WBTC)
- **Asset**: Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)
- **Rationale**: Bitcoin remains the digital gold standard and primary store of value
- **Market Position**: Largest cryptocurrency by market cap and institutional adoption
- **Risk Profile**: Lower volatility, established store of value
- **Growth Drivers**: Institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, limited supply

#### Secondary Holdings (25% - WETH)
- **Asset**: Wrapped Ethereum (WETH)
- **Rationale**: Leading smart contract platform with dominant DeFi ecosystem
- **Market Position**: Second-largest cryptocurrency with highest developer activity
- **Risk Profile**: Medium volatility, high utility and adoption
- **Growth Drivers**: Layer 2 scaling, institutional DeFi adoption, EIP-1559 deflationary mechanism

#### Growth Holdings (10% - WSOL)
- **Asset**: Wrapped Solana (WSOL)
- **Rationale**: High-performance blockchain with growing ecosystem
- **Market Position**: Emerging smart contract platform with unique advantages
- **Risk Profile**: Higher volatility, high growth potential
- **Growth Drivers**: Low fees, high throughput, growing DeFi ecosystem

### Yield Generation Strategy

#### Automated Yield Deployment
- **Primary Protocols**: Automated liquidity provision to Uniswap V3 and Aave V3
- **Deployment Strategy**: 80% of the underlying portfolio assets (WBTC, WETH, WSOL) deployed for yield generation
- **Reserve Requirement**: 20% of portfolio assets maintained in contract for withdrawals

### Value Accrual Mechanism

#### How Yield Bolsters FORT Token Value
The automated yield generation system directly enhances the value of existing FORT tokens through a sophisticated value accrual mechanism:

**Direct Value Appreciation**
- **Yield Reinvestment**: Generated yield from Uniswap V3 and Aave V3 is automatically reinvested into the portfolio
- **Portfolio Growth**: As the underlying portfolio (WBTC, WETH, WSOL) grows from yield, each FORT token represents a larger share of the total value
- **Compound Effect**: Reinvested yields generate additional returns, creating exponential growth over time
- **No Dilution**: New yield is added to the existing portfolio without minting new FORT tokens, increasing the value per token

**Value Distribution Process**
1. **Yield Collection**: Automated systems collect yield from liquidity provision and lending activities
2. **Portfolio Rebalancing**: Yield is used to purchase additional WBTC, WETH, and WSOL at current market prices
3. **Value Accrual**: The increased portfolio value is reflected in the exchange rate between FORT tokens and ETH
4. **Token Holder Benefit**: Existing FORT token holders automatically benefit from the increased portfolio value

**Transparent Value Tracking**
- **Real-time Valuation**: Portfolio value is continuously calculated using Chainlink price feeds
- **Exchange Rate Updates**: FORT token exchange rate updates automatically as portfolio value changes
- **Yield Attribution**: All yield generated is attributed to the existing token supply
- **No Token Inflation**: FORT token supply remains constant while underlying value grows

**Long-term Value Creation**
- **Sustainable Growth**: Yield generation provides consistent, sustainable value appreciation
- **Market Independence**: Value growth is not dependent on FORT token price speculation
- **Compound Returns**: Reinvested yields create compound growth over time
- **Risk-Adjusted Returns**: Diversified yield sources provide stable, risk-adjusted returns

### Governance and Risk Management

#### DAO Governance Structure
- **Voting Power**: Proportional to FORT token holdings
- **Proposal Types**: Protocol upgrades, parameter changes, emergency actions
- **Voting Periods**: 7-day voting periods for standard proposals
- **Quorum Requirements**: Minimum participation thresholds for validity
- **Execution Delays**: Timelock mechanisms for security

#### Risk Management Framework
- **Portfolio Limits**: Maximum concentration limits for individual assets
- **Rebalancing Triggers**: Automatic rebalancing when allocations drift >5%
- **Circuit Breakers**: Emergency stops for extreme market conditions
- **Insurance Fund**: Reserve fund for covering potential losses
- **Audit Requirements**: Regular third-party security audits

## Technical Architecture

### System Overview

Fortress Finance is built on a modular, upgradeable architecture that prioritizes security, efficiency, and user experience. The system consists of multiple interconnected smart contracts that work together to provide seamless portfolio management and yield generation.

#### Upgradeable Contract Architecture

Fortress Finance implements the **UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard)** pattern, ensuring that the protocol can evolve and improve over time while maintaining user funds and state integrity. This upgradeable architecture provides several critical benefits:

**Why Upgradeability is Essential for Fortress Finance:**

1. **Security Enhancements**: Ability to patch vulnerabilities and implement security improvements without requiring users to migrate funds
2. **Feature Evolution**: Continuous improvement of yield strategies, governance mechanisms, and user experience
3. **Protocol Adaptation**: Response to changing market conditions and new DeFi opportunities
4. **Asset Protection**: Guaranteed preservation of user assets and portfolio state during upgrades
5. **Future-Proofing**: Ability to integrate new assets, strategies, and blockchain ecosystems

**Upgrade Safety Measures:**
- **State Preservation**: All user balances, portfolio allocations, and transaction history are preserved during upgrades
- **Asset Protection**: User funds are never at risk during the upgrade process
- **Governance Control**: Only the protocol owner can authorize upgrades, with future DAO governance planned
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Extensive test suites ensure upgrades maintain all existing functionality
- **Transparent Process**: All upgrades are publicly verifiable and auditable

**Technical Implementation:**
- **UUPS Pattern**: Uses OpenZeppelin's UUPS upgradeable proxy pattern
- **Implementation Contracts**: Separate implementation contracts for different versions
- **Proxy Storage**: All state variables stored in the proxy contract, not implementation

## Smart Contracts

The smart contracts are located in the `contracts/` directory. The project includes both standard and upgradeable versions:

### Contract Versions

#### Standard Contracts
- **`FortressToken.sol`**: Standard implementation with all core functionality
- **`mocks/`**: Mock contracts for testing (MockERC20, MockChainlinkPriceFeed, MockStrategy)

#### Upgradeable Contracts
- **`FortressTokenUpgradeable.sol`**: UUPS upgradeable implementation with all core functionality
- **`FortressTokenV2.sol`**: Version 2 with enhanced fee tracking and volume analytics
- **`FortressTokenV3.sol`**: Version 3 with advanced governance and user analytics

### Token Supply Management

#### Maximum Supply Limit
The FORT token has a **maximum supply of 1 billion tokens** (`MAX_SUPPLY = 1_000_000_000 * 10**18`). This limit is enforced in the `invest()` function to prevent unlimited token inflation and maintain the economic integrity of the protocol.

**Why 1 Billion Tokens?**
1. **Industry Standard**: 1 billion is a common maximum supply used by many successful DeFi tokens (Uniswap's UNI, Chainlink's LINK)
2. **Economic Flexibility**: Allows token prices to range from very small ($0.001) to very large ($1000+) while maintaining reasonable market cap ranges
3. **Psychological Appeal**: A round, easily understandable number that feels substantial but not infinite
4. **Precision**: 18 decimals with 1 billion tokens provides sufficient granularity for all calculations

**Implementation Details:**
- The `MAX_SUPPLY` constant is defined in all contract versions
- Enforcement occurs in the `invest()` function: `require(totalSupply() + fortAmount <= MAX_SUPPLY, "Maximum supply exceeded");`
- This check happens **before** minting tokens, ensuring no supply overflow
- The limit is preserved across contract upgrades (V1 â†’ V2 â†’ V3)
- Users can still redeem tokens when at maximum supply
- New investments become possible again after redemptions reduce total supply

**Economic Implications:**
- Provides a clear upper bound for token supply, preventing hyperinflation
- Creates scarcity value as the protocol approaches maximum capacity
- Maintains predictable economics for long-term planning
- Ensures the protocol remains sustainable even with massive adoption
