- ✅ Add comprehensive test suite (80 tests, 100% passing)
- Connect to safe, audited yield sources:
  - Uniswap V3 (for concentrated liquidity provision)
  - Aave V3 (for WBTC / WETH / WSOL lending yield)
- Implement performance fee harvesting to feeAddress
- Proof-of-reserves dashboard using on-chain data + Chainlink oracles

### 📊 Economic Goals

- Launch transparent treasury dashboard (NAV, composition, yield metrics, withdrawal limits)
- Implement DAO governance interface for protocol parameter changes
- Attract early strategic investors with simplified ETH-only investment model
- Launch community channels (Discord, Twitter, Medium, etc.)
- Deploy automated yield generation system
- Demonstrate sustainable yield revenue generation

- Launch on-chain proof-of-reserves API for external integrations
- Integrate with major DEXes for liquid FORT/ETH & FORT/BTC pairs
- Enhanced basket management with DEX integrations for automatic asset swapping
- Circuit breakers and advanced risk management features

### 📊 Economic Goals

- **Target AUM:** $50–100M
- **Target Net Yield:** 5–8% annualized

## 🏦 Phase 3 — Decentralization & Governance (18–36 months)

**Goal:** Gradually decentralize the protocol into a DAO-governed, community-owned yield asset.

### 🧰 Technical Milestones

- Deploy governance token (FORT DAO) with voting power proportional to staking or LP participation
- On-chain governance for:
  - Asset allocation & rebalancing rules
  - Fee parameter changes (investment, redemption, management, performance fees)
  - Treasury deployment & grants
  - Yield strategy selection and parameters
  - Withdrawal limit adjustments
  - Basket management and DEX integration parameters
- Launch protocol-owned liquidity strategy to stabilize token markets
- Multi-sig + timelock upgrades for security

### 📊 Economic Goals

- **Target AUM:** $250–500M
- **Target Net Yield:** 6–10% annualized
- **Facilitator Revenue:** Sustainable margin collection from high-volume trading
- **Yield Generation Revenue:** Proven track record of profitable automated yield generation
- Increase share of protocol revenue to the DAO treasury

### 📢 Go-to-Market

- Launch governance forum & structured proposal process
- Onboard strategic institutions (family offices, crypto hedge funds, DAOs)
- Initiate structured treasury diversification campaigns to use FORT as a reserve asset
- Demonstrate successful automated yield generation operations
- Expand yield strategy selection to community-approved protocols

---

## 🌍 Phase 4 — Fortress Reserve Asset (3–5 years)

**Goal:** Position Fortress as a "super-hard-money" index — a global, decentralized yield-bearing store of value.

### 🧰 Technical Milestones

- DAO fully controls yield strategy, fee structure, and oracle risk parameters
- Multi-chain expansion (L2s and other ecosystems)
- Collateral integrations with:
  - Aave
  - MakerDAO
  - Compound
- Create FORT-backed stablecoin or credit markets (optional advanced product)
- Institutional on/off-ramps and compliance integrations

### 📊 Economic Goals

- **Target AUM:** $1B+
- **Sustainable Net Yield:** 6–12% annualized
- **Facilitator Revenue:** Institutional-scale margin collection
- **Yield Generation:** Global automated yield operations across multiple protocols
- Fortress becomes a core collateral asset in DeFi

### 📢 Go-to-Market

- FORT integrated into treasuries of DAOs, on-chain funds, and potentially traditional finance players
- Recognition as a yield-bearing, inflation-hedged index
- Brand and governance reputation mature to "blue chip DeFi" level

## ✅ Vision Statement

**In short: you're not just launching a token.**

You're architecting a simplified, decentralized, yield-bearing monetary asset that makes diversified crypto investing as easy as sending ETH. The platform combines the stability of Bitcoin, the utility of Ethereum, and the performance of Solana in a single, community-governed investment vehicle.

**Key Innovation:** ETH-only investment with automatic basket management removes the complexity of multi-asset DeFi while maintaining the benefits of diversification and yield generation.
